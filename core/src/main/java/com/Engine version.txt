-Now camera can be set with StretchViewport or ExtendedViewport, or any other viewPort. It needs to be set in config file
using "cameraViewport". Values can be extend, stretch, fit, fill, screen.
-Changed how "InterfaceController" handled inputs. It used camera projection on every single widget. Optimized
code to not do that every single time. It only needs to be done once or twice (depending if there is absolute
and fixed widgets).

-FixedCamera now uses ExtendedViewport.
-Removed "getTimeFrame" from Engine which was final int variable set to 60. Why do we even needed this?
-Minor documentation change to be more readable.
-Engine's dispose method was trying to dispose font data two times. It could crash app. Removed double disposal.
It was trying to dispose freeTypeFont data. That data should be disposed after font was created or just added
to disposable list separately. Using Engine's "generateFont" methods would take care of it, so no need to worry.
Removed from Resources that font disposing. It just crashes the app before closing. It only works if there
is nothing to dispose, so guess it means it should not be used. Where it came from I don't remember, but
now it is gone.
-Constructor a bit adjusted documentation. A bit more info in several methods.
-ImagesLoader replaced GdxPongy.getInstance to Engine.getInstance.

-In Resources class was added SoundController instance. It is optional, so in order for this class to manage it you will need to
call "initializeSoundController". To get instance you need to call "getSoundController". SoundController instance will be automatically
disposed when application is closed.
-ProgressBar still used percentage divided by 100 somewhere in code. It was not used anyway. Still fixed it.
-Fixed ProgressBar drawing bug with angle. Now it draws as correctly as it should no matter what angle it is.
-Engine's "setError" methods marked as deprecated. Use normal throw error methods.

-Fixed default font loading. ViewPort now updates it's world coordinates which are used
in default font loading. No more division from 0.

-InputProcessor changed "scrolled(int amount)" to "scrolled(float amountX, float amountY)". It caused engine to fail to start.
Fixed implementation inside classes: "Window", "TopPainter", "Inputs", "Form", "InterfaceController", "Interface", "Panel", "PopMeniu",
"ScrollView", "TabControl",
-"Form" from com.engine.interfaces "scrolled" removed final tag. It can be overridden now.
-"Form", "InterfaceController", "PopUp" used "GdxPongy" to get Engine instance. Removed that and changed to "Engine.getInstance()".
-Changed the way Resources works. Now calling load methods with already defined keys will not cause errors. It will be just
ignored. It will log, that key already exists. Now this is user responsibility to not add multiple textures/TextureAtlases/
SpriteAnimations to same key. Best idea is not to create texture itself, but just pass file location - this way if key already
exists Disposable object will not be created twice.
